# QMK Config for Corne V4.1

This repository contains my custom QMK firmware configuration for the [Corne V4.1](https://github.com/foostan/kbd_firmware/tree/main/keyboards/crkbd/qmk/qmk_firmware) split keyboard. It includes keymaps and layers, specifically designed for my personal use case.

- **QMK Firmware**: To compile and flash your firmware, make sure you have QMK set up. You can follow the [QMK setup guide](https://docs.qmk.fm/#/newbs_getting_started) to get started.
- **Corne V4.1 Keyboard**: This configuration is specifically designed for the Corne V4.1. Ensure your keyboard has the correct hardware.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/krsntn/qmk-config-corne.git

   ```

2. Install QMK firmware (if not already done):

   ```bash
   python3 -m pip install --user qmk
   ```

3. Set up your QMK environment:

   ```bash
   qmk setup
   ```

4. Compile the firmware for your Corne:

   ```bash
   qmk compile -kb crkbd/rev4_1/standard -km krsntn
   ```

5. Flash the firmware to your Corne:

   1. **Enter Bootloader Mode**:

      - Press and hold the **boot** button, then immediately press the **reset** button to put your Corne into bootloader mode.

   2. **Flash the Firmware**:

      - Once in bootloader mode, simply copy the `.uf2` file to your Corneâ€™s drive to flash the firmware.
